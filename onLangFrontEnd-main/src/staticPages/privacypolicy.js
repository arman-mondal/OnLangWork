                          <li>Types of Data / Privacy Policy Scope 
                            <br /> “Personal Data” means any information about an individual from which that person can be
                            identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).<br />
                            We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of Personal Data about you which we
                            have grouped together below. Not all of the following types of data will necessarily be
                            collected from you but this is the full scope of data that we collect and when we collect it from
                            you:<br />
                            <ol type="i">
                              <li>Profile/Identity Data: This is data relating to your first name, last name, gender, date of birth.</li>

                              <li>Billing Data: This is information relating to your debit and credit card information such as the name attached to your payment details and your billing address.</li>
                              <li>Transactional Data: This is information of details and records of all payments you have made for our services or products.</li>

                          <li>
                            The Legal Basis for Collecting That Data <br />
                            There are a number of justifiable reasons under the GDPR that allow collection and processing
                            of Personal Data. The main avenues we rely on are: <br />
                            <ol type="i">
                              <li>“Consent”: Certain situations allow us to collect your Personal Data, such as when you tick a box that confirms you are happy to receive email newsletters from us, or ‘opt in’ to a service.</li>
                              <li>“Contractual Obligations”: We may require certain information from you in order to fulfil our contractual obligations and provide you with the promised service.</li>
                              <li>“Legal Compliance”: We’re required by law to collect and process certain types of data, such as fraudulent activity or other illegal actions.</li>
                              <li>“Legitimate Interest”: We might need to collect certain information from you to be able to meet our legitimate interests - this covers aspects that can be reasonably expected as part of running our business, that will not have a material impact on your rights, freedom or interests. Examples could be your address, so that we know where to deliver something to, or your name, so that we have a record of who to contact moving forwards.</li>
                            </ol>
                          </li>

                            reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible
                            with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the
                            new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.<br />
                            If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will
                            explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. <br />

                            compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</li>

                              We are concerned with keeping your data secure and protecting it from inappropriate
                              disclosure. We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the security of your
                              Personal Data on our systems, including We will implement a set of IP pools and firewalls
                              configurations to protect users data. Any Personal Data collected by us is only accessible by a
                              limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems and are bound
                              by obligations of confidentiality. If and when we use subcontractors to store your data, we will
                              not relinquish control of your Personal Data or expose it to security risks that would not have
                              arisen had the data remained in our possession. However, unfortunately no transmission of

                              parties not under the control of On Lang Ltd to intercept or access transmissions or private
                              communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your Personal Data, we cannot ensure
                              or warrant the security of any Personal Data you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done

                              us.</li>

                            out in this Privacy Policy. Continued access or use of On Lang Ltd will constitute your express

                        <h5>INTERPRETATION</h5>
                        <ol>
                          <li>All uses of the word "including" mean "including but not limited to" and the enumerated examples
                            are not intended to in any way limit the term which they serve to illustrate. Any email addresses set
                            out in this policy may be used solely for the purpose for which they are stated to be provided, and
                            any unrelated correspondence will be ignored. Unless otherwise required by law, we reserve the
                            right to not respond to emails, even if they relate to a legitimate subject matter for which we have
                            provided an email address. As a matter of common sense, you are more likely to get a reply if your
                            request or question is polite, reasonable and there is no relatively obvious other way to deal with or
                            answer your concern or question (e.g. FAQs, other areas of our website etc.). <br />
                            Our staff are not authorised to contract on behalf of On Lang Ltd, waive rights or make
                            representations (whether contractual or otherwise). If anything contained in an email from a On Lang
                            Ltd address contradicts anything in this policy, our terms or any official public announcement on our
                            website, or is inconsistent with or amounts to a waiver of any On Lang Ltd rights, the email content
                            will be read down to grant precedence to the latter. The only exception to this is genuine
                            correspondence expressed to be from the On Lang Ltd legal department.</li>
